# Online Section UI Design

The Online section provides access to user-generated content, including levels and solutions.

## Level Browser

The level browser allows users to search and filter public levels. On the left side is a page for levels uploaded by users, and the right side a demo screen showing the selected level (starting status), below which the level metadata (author, upload date, number of plays/completions, description, difficulty rating) is shown. If the player has completed the level before, their best score (moves taken) is also shown.

Players can filter levels by name and author (@author:), uuid (@uuid: and @uuid-start:) and sort by:
1. Recently uploaded
2. Most played (all time)
3. Most played (weekly)
4. Completed/Not completed
5. Difficulty rating (1-5 stars)

The search bar and filters are at the top of the level browser page.

## Solution Browser

The solution browser allows users to browse and search for user-uploaded solutions to levels. The solutions are filterable by level uuid. Solutions can be played back.
